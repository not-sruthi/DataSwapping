#Write a custom defined function in Python.
#Write code for swapping the data in the files.

#Create a swappingFile.py file.
#Create 2 sample text files and name them sample1.txt and sample2.txt
#Define a swapFileData function using def
#Use inputs to take the names of the files to swap.

#Open file 1 in writing mode and write data_b to it.
#Open file 2 in writing mode and write data_a to it.
#Call the function.
#Save the code.
